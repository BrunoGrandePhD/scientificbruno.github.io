Dear Wet Lab People, 

As a computational biologist, I wish you disturbed us at our workstations with 
the same caution and reluctance you have towards disturbing other wet lab 
people doing bench work.
I have a little theory that you subconsciously extrapolate that your downtime 
is when you're at the computer to dry lab members.
Let me remind you that this is **not** the case. 

<!--more-->

All you need to do is wait until I step away from the computer before asking or
telling me something. 
Also, avoid having loud conversations nearby when I'm at the computer.
In doing so, you will not distract me while I precariously hold the control 
flow of the program I'm working on in the front of my mind. 
Otherwise, I lose this mental model and need to recreate it from scratch every 
time I'm disrupted, which is grossly inefficient and increases the risk of 
software bugs. 

Thank you for your understanding. 

Sincerely, 
<br>
Bruno
