I've literally lost count of the number of times I've "relaunched" my blog. They all ended up being futile attempts at motivating myself to write more. This might very well be another one of those attempts, and this might end up as another lonely "My First Blog Post". 

I think this is the part where I'm supposed to sound more optimistic.

On a more serious note, my inspiration for starting this blog is twofold. First, I got my hands on a really cool domain name, [bgran.de](http://bgran.de). And there's nothing quite like a clever domain name to motivate a nerd to launch a website. Second, a colleague of mine, Fong Chun Chan ([<i class="fa fa-twitter"></i>](https://twitter.com/fongchunchan) & [<i class="fa fa-github"></i>](https://github.com/tinyheero)), began blogging last summer. A few weeks ago, I stumbled upon one of his latest posts, [Using Mixture Models for Clustering in R](http://tinyheero.github.io/2015/10/13/mixture-model.html). I was simply blown away. His article was an excellent explanation and demonstration of mixture models; everything was crystal clear. This made me realize that I want to share the knowledge I gain during my graduate studies, as my way of [paying it forward](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pay_it_forward). Although, realistically speaking, I'll probably be my own audience when I inevitably google for an error I've already run into but forgot about.

Mm, I think I'm tentatively starting to feel slightly optimistic and cautiously excited about this renewed effort to blog. We'll see what comes out of it!
