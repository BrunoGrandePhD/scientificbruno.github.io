As the most "senior" computational biologist in a relatively new cancer genomics 
research lab (less than 4 years old), I get asked many questions relating to 
data analyses, software tools, system administration, etc.
I enjoy helping othersâ€”to a fault actually, and I'll get back to this later. 
Despite my willingness to help, it simply isn't sustainable for me to be the 
recipient of every technical question that goes through the minds of my lab 
mates. 
Not that it's this extreme, but there's a continuum between being asked no 
questions and ALL the questions and a balance needs to be struck.

Originally, when our lab was small (~5 members), we were all able to fit in one
space.
Needless to say, it's trivial to ask someone a question if they are sitting in 
the same room as you.
I found my days peppered by interruptions from others; admittedly, I was
agreeing to answering them in the first place.
At some point, the lab grew beyond the capacity of that space and I moved to 
another room just down the hall.

Not surprisingly, the number of questions I was asked dropped significantly.
The reason is simple: being a few steps away as opposed to being within earshot
forces people to think twice before asking something.
Three cheers for people being lazy. Hooray! Hooray! Hooray!
And I won't lie: I definitely benefited from the reduced number of distractions.
Any programmer can relate to how detrimental distractions can be to 
concentration and thus productivity.

About one year later, I obtained a desk in the neighbouring city at the Genome
Sciences Centre, where all the computational biologists work, several of 
which on cancer genomics. 
I've been interested in getting a spot there for some time in order to immerse
myself in an environment relevant to my research.
Note that my departmental affiliation is Molecular Biology and Biochemistry, 
meaning they mostly focus on wet lab experiments and not computational
biology; although there are a few bioinformatics labs. 
Now, I'm surrounded by no one from my lab and I've had some of my most 
productive days at the Genome Sciences Centre.
