*Jump to the bottom of this article if all you want is the etiquette.*

My research lab started using Slack three months ago and we recently reached the 
10,000-message archive limit allowed for free accounts. 
My supervisor is now raising the question of whether we use it enough to justify
upgrading to a paid account in order to access our entire message archive.
The general concensus among my lab mates is that Slack has been very useful in 
the short time it has been implemented. 
They see the value in it and think it's worthwhile to upgrade. 
As an academic lab, we also benefit from a 85% discount on the annual cost per
user, which makes the decision of upgrading less painful. 
Personally, it's been useful to eliminate the need for meetings and I wanted to
continue using it for a few more months under probation. 
However, there was something that was bothering me about Slack, which is why
I was reluctant to commit to it fully right away.
