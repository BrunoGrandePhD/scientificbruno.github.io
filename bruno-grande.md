I am currently undertaking my PhD studies in cancer genomics under the supervision of [Ryan Morin](http://www.sfu.ca/mbb/People/Morin/) at Simon Fraser University (SFU). As a computational biologist, I interrogate large sequencing datasets derived from tumour DNA or RNA using a wide range of analytical methods. Our research aims to discern the biological processes that are implicated in tumour initiation and progression. So far, I've worked with paediatric osteosarcoma and non-Hodgkin lymphomas. In particular, one of my projects focuses on Burkitt lymphoma, a subtype of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that is predominant among African children, but also arises in developed countries. I hope to eventually write a blog post describing my research in more detail. I'll link to it here once it's published. 

Outside of my PhD research, I try to make a difference in my community wherever I can. Currently, I serve as president of the [MBB Graduate Caucus](http://www.sfu.ca/mbbgradcaucus.html), whose objective is to represent all graduate students in the Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry (MBB) at SFU and organize academic and social events for the department. I also co-organize the [Scientific Programming Study Group](http://sciprog.ca) (SciProg), which aims to build a scientific programming community at SFU and promote skill sharing and collaboration. I was recently involved in bringing a 3-day [Research Bazaar](http://melbourne.resbaz.edu.au/) to Vancouver/Burnaby in collaboration with the SFU's Research Commons in February 2016. Because I can't get enough of seeing these community events come together, I've joined the steering committee in charge of putting together Vancouver's first ever Genomics Hackathon, [Hackseq](http://www.hackseq.com/), in October 2016. Last but not least, I'm a certified [Software Carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org/) and [Data Carpentry](http://www.datacarpentry.org/) instructor, because I absolutely enjoy promoting and teaching digital literacy skills in addition to sharing methodologies that enable open science.
