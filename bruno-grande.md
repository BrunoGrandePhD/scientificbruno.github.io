I am currently undertaking my PhD studies in cancer genomics under the supervision of [Ryan Morin](http://www.sfu.ca/mbb/People/Morin/) at Simon Fraser University. As a computational biologist, I interrogate large sequencing datasets derived from tumour DNA or RNA using a wide range of analytical methods. Our research aims to discern the biological processes that are implicated in tumour initiation and progression. So far, I've worked with paediatric osteosarcoma and non-Hodgkin lymphomas. In particular, one of my projects focuses on Burkitt lymphoma, a subtype of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that is predominant among African children, but also affects developed countries. I hope to write a blog post describing my research projects in more detail. I'll link to them here once they're published. 

I also greatly enjoy teaching and have been volunteering with a few organizations such as [Software Carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org/) and [Ladies Learning Code](http://ladieslearningcode.com/). Additionally, some colleagues and I have created the [Scientific Programming Study Group at SFU](http://sciprog.ca), which offers weekly one-hour sessions for the local scientific programming community. I'm also helping organize a [Research Bazaar](http://melbourne.resbaz.edu.au/) here in Vancouver/Burnaby!
