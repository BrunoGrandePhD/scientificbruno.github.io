I am currently undertaking my PhD studies in cancer genomics under the supervision of Ryan Morin. As a computational biologist, I interrogate large sequencing datasets derived from tumour biopsies using a wide range of analytical methods. I'm also involved with several organizations, such as Software Carpentry and the Scientific Programming Study Group at SFU.
